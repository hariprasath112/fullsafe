## Navigation in the application
The program allows clicking `Enter` key to jump to the next value, this also has the feature of triggering the functions associated with them. The default chain of navigation through `Enter` Key where each `-->` denotes a click of `Enter` key

`Invoice Date` --> `Invoice Date` --> `GST No.` --> Generates Seller Name and Address from GST No. and autofills --> `Product Name` --> `HSN` --> `Sub Total` --> Generates Tax value and Total Value --> `Total` --> `Submit` --> Adds to Spreadsheet and clear all Fields --> `Invoice Date`

Just like using Microsoft Excel you can navigate the entire software with `Enter` keys, thus saving time that is consumed with mannual navigation using a mouse.

## Entry Configuration
The `Entry Month` is always set to previous month. `Entry Year` is set to always display current year, adjustments has been made to display previous year during the month of December (i.e. entry takes place on January)
### File naming
The details are automatically stored in an `.xlsx` file once `Submit` button is hit. The file is stored in the location `E:\fullsafe\{year}\{month}` and the file name is in the format `Purchase_{month}{year}.xlsx`. The `Month` and `year` is determined from the values of `Entry Month` and `Entry Year`.
### Accessing File
The `File` item in the menubar can be clicked to open the file immediately.

## Input Specifications

### Sub Total
After entering the subtotal, when you click `Enter` key the `Tax Amount` and `Total` are generated and the cursor jumps to total. 
### Submit button
After confirming the `Total` value you can press `Enter` again, which leads you to the `Submit` button. The data will be uploaded only after you press `Enter` a second time. After than click, the data is added to Excel file and all columns are erased.
#### Submit & Reuse Button
This button does the same upload function as the `Submit` button but excludes clearing the `GST No`, `Business Name` and `Business Address` fields. It is suited for entering multiple receipts from same seller. It has to be manually clicked before the second `Enter` click when the `Submit` button is highlighted, preferably once the `Total` is generated.
#### Clear button
This clears all values. Only default values like `Entry Month`, `Entry Year` and `Invoice Date` remains.
